# Lock Screen Styling Guide
This section shows how to customise the Lock Screen for Windows 10 and Windows 11.

If this is your first time customising the XAML styles, check out the UWPSpy guide [here](https://github.com/bbmaster123/FWFU/blob/main/uwpspy.md).

- Launch UWPSpy
- Look for `LockApp.exe`. If it doesn't show up, lock your PC at least once by pressing `Win`+`L`, unlock your PC, then click "Refresh"
- While `LockApp.exe` is selected, press `Tab` twice so it selects the "Spy" button
- Press `Enter` then immediately `Win`+`L`
- The UWPSpy window should appear on the Lock Screen, you can now customise it

While customising the Lock Screen, you cannot copy the target names to clipboard. To workaround this:
- Take a screenshot of the UWPSpy window by pressing `Win`+`PrtScr`, or just `PrtScr`
- Unlock your PC, you will lose the UWPSpy window and you need to re-spy to customise the Lock Screen again
- Launch MS Paint
- Paste the screenshot by pressing `Ctrl`+`V`
- Save it as PNG file
- Launch Snipping Tool from Start Menu
- Click the `•••` button → Open file
- Open the saved screenshot file
- Use the text extraction (OCR) feature

If it says the texts are too small to detect:
- Zoom in the screenshot in the Snipping too app
- Take a screenshot again with `Shift`+`Win`+`S`
- Click the Snipping Tool notification to replace the current screenshot with a zoomed-in one
- Try using the OCR again
