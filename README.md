# Windows XAML Styles
A collection of my custom Windows XAML styles for Windhawk's various XAML styler mods.

## File Explorer

* Custom button glyphs: Back, Forward, Up, More
* Mica effect extended to the Command Bar
* Dynamic image container height for the Details Pane
* Removed the tab's Close button (to close the tab, middle-click it or press Ctrl+W)
* Context Menu: Removed the Share options & "Show more options"

## Notification Center

* Large album art image for the Quick Actions' Media Controls

## Lock Screen

For [Windows 11 Start Menu Styler](https://windhawk.net/mods/windows-11-start-menu-styler) - fork the mod and change the target process to `LockApp.exe`

* Moved the Clock & Date HUD to the top-left corner of the screen
* Removed the UI elements for Fun facts, tips & "Like the image that you see?",
those can be turned off via Settings → Personalisation → Lock screen, but it affects only the non-Spotlight pics.
These custom styles can force remove them for Spotlight pics too.
* Large album art image for the Media Controls
